                    and youth getting fair opportunities to explore and pursue their dreams in technology. We believe
                    that women make up an enormous part of the demographics and influence the majority of needs of the
                    society. Their representation in tech is essential for companies to perform better organizationally.
                    Achieving gender diversity in tech is what we are ultimately aiming for. </div>

                    expand access to opportunities in tech for young women. We aim at making use of all the available
                    resources to reach out to women and encourage them to get into technical fields.
                    We are stepping forward to building up confidence in women by helping them acquire the necessary
                    skills and introducing them to the perks of working in the technical industry and making them
                    realize how they can be a great asset, a positive change, to the society by being a part of it. We
                    still have a very long way to go, but it's achievable and so shall we.

            <div class="fs-4 text-justify px-3 mt-0" style="font-family: 'Baloo Bhai 2', cursive;"> <br>WiTech (Women in Technology) is a registered non-profit
                organization that was founded in the Philippines by Audrey P in 2016. WiTech aims to educate,
                inspire and empower women and youth to break gender barriers, pursue careers in tech, and use their
                abilities to make a difference in society. <br>

                After discovering a huge gender gap in the tech industry, Audrey started a blog wherein she posted
                articles featuring women in tech she interviewed to promote their stories and celebrate their journeys
                in the male - dominated fields.
                <br>
                In 2017, WiTech rebranded into a community organization that now has hundreds of people in the 7
                branches across the world - and counting!
